日天的歌曲推荐节目尝试  
二人第一个MP3的故事  
海边的曼彻斯特和悲伤情绪  
人一辈子只喝喝固定量的酒

> You make the sun shine brighter than Doris Day.

这是最后一首歌《wake me up before you go go》的歌词，
竟然还点题了，真是与音乐有缘！

Dream a Little Dream of Me 不是菲茨杰拉德的歌：

It was first recorded in February 1931 by Ozzie Nelson and also by Wayne King and His Orchestra, with vocal by Ernie Birchill. A popular standard, it has seen more than 60 other versions recorded, with one of the highest chart ratings by the Mamas & the Papas in 1968 with Cass Elliot on lead vocals.
