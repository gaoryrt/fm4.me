A still frame from the music video of the song "Never Gonna Give You Up" by Rick Astley on YouTube, taken in 2008.
Rickrolling, alternatively rick-rolling, is a prank and an Internet meme involving an unexpected appearance of the music video for the 1987 Rick Astley song "Never Gonna Give You Up". The meme is a type of bait and switch using a disguised hyperlink that leads to the music video. The victims, believing that they are accessing some unrelated material, are said to have been rickrolled.[1] The trend has extended to disruptive or humorous appearances of the song in other situations, such as a live appearance of Astley himself in the 2008 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York.[2]

History
"Never Gonna Give You Up" appeared on Astley's 1987 debut album Whenever You Need Somebody.[3] The song, his solo debut single, was a number-one hit on several international charts, including the Billboard Hot 100, Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks, and the UK Singles Chart. The accompanying music video, Astley's first, features him performing the song while dancing.[4]

The song's eventual Internet popularity may be traced back to a 2005 episode of It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia, "Charlie Has Cancer", in which the song is used quite prominently. Rickrolling was reported to have begun as a variant of an earlier prank from the imageboard 4chan known as duckrolling. The director of the site, who went by the name "m00t," started replacing occurrences of the word "egg" on the site with the word "duck." When the word "eggroll" was turned into "duckroll," users started changing links to sensational pictures or news items so that they instead connected users to an edited picture of a duck with wheels; the user was then said to have been "duckrolled."[1][5]
